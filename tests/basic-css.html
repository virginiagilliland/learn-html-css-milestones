  <p style="color:blue;">A new study of Greenland's shrinking ice sheet reveals that many of the island's glaciers are not only retreating, <br>
    but are also undergoing other physical changes. Some of those changes are causing the rerouting of freshwater rivers <br>
    beneath the glaciers, where it meets the bedrock. These rivers carry nutrients into the ocean, so this reconfiguring  <br>
    has the potential to impact the local ecology as well as the human communities that depend on it. <br>

    "The coastal environment in Greenland is undergoing a major transformation," said Alex Gardner, a research scientist at <br>
    NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and co-author of the study. "We are already seeing new sections of the ocean and fjords <br>
    opening up as the ice sheet retreats, and now we have evidence of changes to these freshwater flows. So losing ice is not <br>
    just about changing sea level, it's also about reshaping Greenland's coastline and altering the coastal ecology." <br>
  </p>
  <p style="color:blue;">
    About 80% of Greenland is blanketed by an ice sheet, also known as a continental glacier, that reaches a thickness of up to <br>
    2.1 miles (3.4 kilometers). Multiple studies have shown that the melting ice sheet is losing mass at an accelerating rate due <br>
     to rising atmosphere and ocean temperatures, and that the additional meltwater is flowing into the sea.<br>
